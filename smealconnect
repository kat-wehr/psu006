<h2>Part 1: SmealConnect
</h2>
<p>This week, we'll get you set up in SmealConnect. SmealConnect is a password-protected career opportunities and networking website designed to connect Penn State Smeal College of Business students and alumni to corporate recruiters. The system is primarily utilized to post internship opportunities for undergraduate students, internship and full-time opportunities for MBAs, and experienced-hire positions for Smeal alumni. Additionally, added features allow on-campus support and coordination for employer interviewing. Click the link below to view the video walkthrough of how to get started with SmealConnect.

</p>
<p>Create your SmealConnect Account if you did not request it last week as directed. Visit <a href="http://careerconnections.smeal.psu.edu/internships-co-ops/smeal-connect/">http://careerconnections.smeal.psu.edu/internships-co-ops/smeal-connect/</a> and scroll to "Accessing the System" for the instructions. It takes 1-2 business days for accounts to be activated.
</p>
<p>Once your account has been created and activated, log in and fill out your profile. This is worth credit for class. I will receive a report of students from our class who are active in SmealConnect.&nbsp;

<h2>Part 2: Preparing Your Resume
</h2>
<p>Now that you have created your SmealConnect profile, we will look toward preparing your resume to attend career events here at Smeal. To get started, please review the following video about resume basics from the Smeal Career and Corporate Connections office.

</p>
<p>After watching the webshop, review the following examples of resumes (there are two pages of examples included in the website below). You may choose to view the resume of the major you intend to pursue, or choose a major that you think you might be interested in to get a sense of the type of work those majors typically do.&nbsp;

<h3>Assignment
</h3>
<p>Create a draft resume and add it as an attachment to a post in the appropriate Canvas discussion forum. You may also wish to bring a printed copy to class if you like. We will be trading resumes and editing them as well as offering suggestions for improvement together in class. After we're done with our workshop, you will make your edits and submit your second versions to VMock.
