<h3>Fresh Start Day of Service
</h3>
<ul><li>Saturday, August 27, 2016</li><li>Sign up at&nbsp;volunteer.psu.edu (register early!)</li><li><a href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/service/FreshStart.shtml">http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/service/FreshStart.shtml</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fresh START Day of Service is one of Penn State's largest days of service, designed for incoming first-year, change-of-campus, and transfer students new to the University Park campus. The primary goals of Fresh START are: 1) to introduce new students to the many service and civic engagement opportunities available in the State College community as well as organiztions at Penn State students can become a part of, 2) to help students build new friendships with other students transitioning to Penn State, and 3) Get students engaged with involvement at Penn State and in the community, all while having FUN!
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fresh START Day of Service encourages new students to “get rooted” in service opportunities in Happy Valley and within student organizations, that they can then engage with throughout their academic careers at Penn State. Our hope is that, through Fresh START, new students will develop a passion for giving back to the community and will continue to engage in service and civic engagement throughout their lives.
