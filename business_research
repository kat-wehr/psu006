<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p>A key question that many students are interested in understanding is "How does what I'm learning here connect to what I'll be doing later?" No one wants to waste time doing things that appear disconnected to their end goal.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This online lesson will attempt to broadly explain&nbsp;how general&nbsp;businesses function,&nbsp;and provide&nbsp;a common framework to discuss how the majors and minors at Smeal fit into what a business actually does. This lesson also aims to help you understand why it's important to do company research and how research helps you prepare to speak to recruiters and stand out in interviews.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>What is a Business?
</h3>
<p>In order to frame this lesson, it's important to start with the basics. So what is a business?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>By definition, a business is any enterprise that <em>creates and delivers value to a customer in exchange for compensation</em>. In practice, a&nbsp;business could be a large corporation comprised of multiple departments, locations, and employees,&nbsp;or just a single individual providing a service. A business can be&nbsp;a for-profit or a not-for-profit (where financial compensation comes through revenue sources other than profit).&nbsp;Business can&nbsp;serve customers all over the world or just those who come into an individual storefront. But no matter how different they may appear, all businesses have the same basic components.
</p>
<h3>Components of a Business
</h3>
<h4>Customer Relationship
</h4>
<p>Every business starts with customers.&nbsp;A customer is any person or organization that has a need that our business is looking to satisfy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Every business has to have customers.&nbsp;Therefore, every business dedicates some substantial part of its resources to identifying customer needs and managing its relationships with those customers – sales people, customer service reps, brand managers, product managers, market research analysts, etc.&nbsp;The common thread among all of these people is that they are collectively managing the firm’s understanding of and relationship with its customers (both actual and potential).

</p>
<h4>Production &amp; Delivery of Goods or Services
</h4>
<p>Once a customer’s need is understood and there is some type of relationship with that customer, the business needs to create and deliver something of value that will meet that need. This activity is a the core of any business and generally defines how we think about a business. Components of business that fall under this category include tasks like:
</p>
<ul><li>operations</li><li>manufacturing</li><li>procurement</li><li>logistics</li><li>information systems</li><li>quality assurance</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Ford is automobile company. It designs, manufactures and sells vehicles based on its understanding of the needs and desires of its potential customers in order to generate profits for its shareholders or owners. For comparison,&nbsp;Penn State is very different kind of business - but still a business nonetheless. Penn State&nbsp;creates and delivers value by providing educational services to its students, and through the creation and dissemination of knowledge through its research and outreach efforts.&nbsp;As a not-for-profit, its fundamental objective is to create value for our society in Pennsylvania and beyond. As our mission statement says, we are striving to “make life better”.
</p>
<p>But regardless of the overall mission, every business must create and deliver a product of value, whether that product is physical like a car, or abstract like an education. And in all of those products, there are many components that go into their production.&nbsp;

</p>
<h4>Resource &amp; Risk Management
</h4>
<p>It is very hard (if not impossible) to create value from nothing. A firm has to have resources that it will use to create the value that it will ultimately deliver to its customers. And the fundamental resources that every firm needs are <em>cash, people, and space.</em> Similarly, every firm faces fundamental risks and needs to proactively find ways to <em>identify and mitigate the risks</em> specific to them. Accordingly, every firm will have people focused on the management of these resources and fundamental risks associated with the business. &nbsp;

</p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong>
</p>
<p>So far, we have discussed how every business has some portion of the their resources/people focused on their customer relationships, has some other portion of those resources focused on the creation and delivery of some value, and a third portion of their resources focused on allocating, controlling, and managing its core resources and risks. &nbsp;What are we missing? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>...Something to coordinate those various efforts and really drive the business forward.
</p>
<h4>Strategy, Innovation, and Leadership
</h4>
<p>Every business needs leadership, strategy, and innovation&nbsp;to survive, let alone survive. &nbsp;Somehow they need to provide the entire organization with a common understanding of how the business will compete in the marketplace. &nbsp;It needs to get everyone headed in the same direction and create the appropriate culture that this specific business needs to successfully compete in the marketplace.
</p>
<p>As we discussed, every business needs to have robust relationships with its customers and understand their needs.&nbsp;Based on that understanding, the business needs to create and deliver value that will meet those needs.&nbsp;And to do that, it must effectively manage its fundamental resources and the related risks.&nbsp;Finally, every business needs to leadership to drive the business forward and get all aspects of the business moving in the same direction.&nbsp;Setting strategy, enabling creativity and innovation, building a culture, motivating everyone involved in the business are all critical activities that every business needs.

<h3>Putting the Pieces Together
</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, the majors here at Smeal are directly aligned with those business functions.&nbsp;As we explore the various aspects and functions of a business, we will also be looking at the majors available at Smeal and the jobs that students from those majors typically enter upon graduation. Click on the infographic below to see how each Smeal major aligns to the core business functions listed above.&nbsp;

</p>
<h3>Summary&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>At this point, you should have a good understanding of the way business functions relate to the options and personalization choices you have when it comes to your major within Smeal. This lesson also should have provided you a good starting point for your majors &amp; careers project, which you will work with your team to complete before the end of the semester.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In addition, this lesson provides foundational knowledge that transfers to the other major assignment you will complete for this class: the Company Research Project. This part of the lesson focuses on the benefits of company research and how you can do research to give yourself a leg up when speaking to recruiters or interviewing with potential employers.&nbsp;

</p>
<h3>Assignment&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>The other major project you will complete for this class is the Company Research project. Part of the company research project is tied to the Majors &amp; Careers project, so it is important to complete the company research project by the deadline so you have all the information you need to finish the Majors &amp; Careers project.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For details on the Company Research project, see the assignment in Canvas. Please note, the Company Research assignment is an individual assignment, however, you should work with your group to decide who will research which companies associated with the major your group chose. After companies have been assigned to group members, the company research is to be done individually. Each group member should only research one company.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please assign your companies to each group member by next week's class. A business librarian will be presenting in class next week to go over how to use the library's databases, so it is appropriate to wait until after the presentation to formally begin if you would like.&nbsp;
