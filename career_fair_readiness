<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=60|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=mediavideo__thumbnail__right]Part of the first year experience at Smeal is preparing students for the professional world. One of the key skills you will utilize again and again throughout your time at Smeal is networking.
</p>
<p>Networking involves making connections with people and organizations and sustaining interactions that can help you, and those you choose to network with, further your goals. There are various types of networking, but we will focus primarily on professional networking in this course. It is important to know that networking can be done in all areas of life where you believe that connections with others can help you achieve a goal, whether it is personal, academic, philanthropic, etc. One of the most important things to remember about networking is that building connections with others should involve some type of mutually beneficial exchange, such as a letter of recommendation, helpful information, or an introduction to someone else.
</p>
<p>For some networking tips, download and review this PDF from PSU Student Affairs: <a href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/pdf/CG/CG_Value_of_Networking.pdf">http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/pdf/CG/CG_Value_of_Networking.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>In order to network effectively, you'll want to attend events related to your personal and professional goals. Before you attend any of these events, it's important to be appropriately prepared. This means knowing how to dress, what to say, writing a resume and having goals in mind before you walk into any event. The topics in this lesson will help you accomplish all of these things in preparation for your career fair assignment. Start by watching the video at the top of the page if you haven't already.
