<h3>Leadership Role Models: Who's in Your Boardroom?
</h3>
<h4>Assignment
</h4>
<p>All leaders need to have good role models and mentors to learn from. Many company leaders will often be tasked with appointing a Board of Directors at some point in their career - this board should be comprised of people with smart business sense and people who the leader trusts to help steer them in the right direction.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For this assignment, identify 3-5 leaders that you would put on your personal board of directors to help guide you on your leadership journey. Remember all the qualities we learned about from the resources in this lesson and think about the type of leader you want to be in order to help you identify your personal boardroom.
</p>
<p>In the appropriate Canvas discussion forum, please post a list of your 3-5 leadership role models (they can be living or dead) and include a brief justification of why each one is on your board. What could each person help you achieve in your professional pursuits?
