<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p>VMock is an online instant resume feedback application. It compares your uploaded resume against other Smeal student resumes and provides detailed feedback to help you to improve your resume. It allows up to 10 uploads per student so you can make changes based on the systemâ€™s feedback and compare your drafts.
</p>
<h2>Accessing VMock
</h2>
<p>Access VMock at the following web address: <a href="https://www.vmock.com/smeal">https://www.vmock.com/smeal</a>
</p>
<p>Enter your PSU email address and click the "Complete Registration" button. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose a secure password, verify your email address, etc.
</p>
<p>Once you have access to the system, upload the newest draft of your resume which we worked on in class. Review the feedback you received. Be sure to take a screen shot of the scores your original draft received in the system.
</p>
<p>Submit your uploaded draft along with your screen shot of the first round of scores to the drop box in Canvas.
</p>
<p>Complete another round of edits. Do this individually based on the feedback you got from VMock. Upload your second draft, review your scores and feedback, and take ANOTHER screen shot of the new scores.
</p>
<p>Upload your new draft AND your screen shot of the second set of scores to the same drop box in Canvas. It is set up to receive multiple submissions.
