<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p>Now that you've got a resume that's been workshopped by your peers and tested through VMock, the next logical step is to begin building your online presence and personal brand with a LinkedIn page. For those who are not familiar with LinkedIn, it helps to think about it like a Facebook page for professional networking as opposed to social networking.

</p>
<p>Your LinkedIn page is a way to digitally market your professional experiences, not only to prospective employers, but also clients and customers. A LinkedIn profile is very similar to a resume in that it is an ever-changing document. As you collect more professional experiences, older jobs and experiences drop off in favor of highlighting more recent, relevant opportunities you have partaken in. Your LinkedIn page allows you to expand on your resume by including work samples and real reviews from others who have worked with you.

<h3>Resume vs. LinkedIn Page: Major Differences
</h3>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=65|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=mediavideo__thumbnail]
</p>
<p>You may be wondering what the purpose of a LinkedIn page is apart from being a digital version of your resume. While your LinkedIn page should definitely include all the information listed in your resume, LinkedIn offers a chance for you to really show off your professional experience in ways that a formal paper document cannot. For example, LinkedIn allows you to upload various multimedia to support the bullet points that appear on a resume: PowerPoint slides from major presentations you were part of, videos or images of products or from projects you contributed to, or sound bytes from any interviews or formal talks you have given. These pieces serve as proof that not only are you as excellent in your field as your resume and cover letter state, but that you have the evidence to back up your claims.
</p>
<h3>Building Your Network
</h3>
<p>The most useful feature of LinkedIn is definitely the network. You can connect with any user on LinkedIn, as long as they approve you as a formal connection. It is generally good practice to only connect with those you have met in a formal setting, whether through a virtual networking opportunity or in person at a career fair or other professional event. Personal the connection request by reminding the individual where you met. For example, writing "Dear Jack, It was great to talk with you about potential accounting internships at your company during the internship fair at Penn State last week. Let's connect on LinkedIn," will get you farther than the standard message that is auto-filled every time you send a connection out.
</p>
<p>The groups feature of LinkedIn is also a great place to learn who the industry leaders are in your field and to get involved with discussions on topics that frequently arise among professionals in your career path of choice. Join groups, watch the discussions and participate where you feel comfortable - this will help grow your visibility on the site and make your profile stand out to recruiters.
</p>
<p>Get started by joining Penn State's Career Connection group, lead by the Penn State Career Services department: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2115499" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2115499</a>
</p>
<p>You can also request to join the Smeal College of Business group on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/101958/profile" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/101958/profile</a>
</p>
<h3>Recommendations for Recommendations
</h3>
<p>LinkedIn also offers a Recommendations section on every profile. This space allows people you've connected with to leave positive feedback about your working experiences. Reviews from coworkers, classmates, professors and employers past and present serve to further illustrate to future connections that you are a well-rounded, skilled professional who delivers on promises and are a pleasure to work with.
</p>
<p>It's important to realize that you can also give recommendations as a member on LinkedIn, and often times you may be asked to leave recommendations for others in exchange for them leaving recommendations for you. Here is a word of caution: Think of your recommendations to others as reflections of the company you keep. Treat your recommendations with respect, they reflect upon you and your ability to assess quality of others' work. If you give a good recommendation to someone who you know is not the hardest worker or most ethical businessperson, and one of your mutual connections works with that person based on your recommendation, you've just diluted the power of your recommendations and the level of trust and influence in your network. Leave recommendations wisely!
