<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p>Teamwork is a necessary part of a successful career. Employers want to hire people who know the value and power of working as a cohesive team - especially those who understand that not everyone can be a leader all the time. As we saw during our in-class activity, the puzzle became easier to solve when the groups worked together as cohesive units.
</p>
<p class="txtbk-pullquote">â€œTeam: A collection of individuals who are interdependent in their tasks and who share responsibility for the outcomes. Teams enable people to cooperate, enhance individual skills and provide constructive feedback without any conflict between individuals."
</p>
<p>There are certain qualities that successful teams tend to have. These qualities will be important to keep in mind as we begin our group projects.

<h3>Being a Team Player
</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to be an effective member of a team is to truly understand yourself and how you interact with others. In my first professional job, my supervisor had all the members of our team take a personality test in order to not only identify our individual strengths, but more so to help us interact successfully with each other. Understanding our strengths, weaknesses, and how our actions may be perceived by others on our team allowed us to work more cohesively as a team.
</p>
<p>For your online participation this week, you will each take a "lite" version of the Myers-Briggs personality test individually. Your result will serve as the basis for your reflection. Remember, it is important to realize that these tests are not always 100% accurate and your results may change over time. I find the Myers-Briggs test helpful in identifying certain trends in personality, not necessarily as an all-encompassing guide to one's personality.
</p>
<p>This version of the test will only take you 10-15 minutes to complete. Be as honest as you can with your answers and try to avoid neutral answers.
</p>
<p>After you complete the test, read your results. While I encourage you to skim through your entire result, pay specific attention to sections 7 &amp; 8 for our assignment - these are the ones that deal with your personality type in the workplace. Again, take these results with a grain of salt. Much like SAT scores, one test is not indicative of an entire person.

</p>
<p>Note: The test should take about 10-15 minutes. You can (and should) email your results to yourself after you're finished for later review if you can't complete the reflection right away.

  <h4>Assignment - MBTI Reflection
  </h4>
  <p>For this assignment, take the Myers Briggs test at the link above. After you have perused the results (especially sections 7 &amp; 8), think about whether you agree with the result you received. Compose a brief reflection that addresses the following:
  </p>
  <p>Does your result line up with your personal view of yourself prior to taking the test? Explain why or why not.
  </p>
  <p>Based on your results for section 7 (Career Paths) and section 8 (Workplace Habits), what value do you believe you bring to the table as part of a team?
  </p>
  <p>Realizing that the professional world isn't always perfect, how does knowing your strengths and weaknesses help you perform better in a team environment? What compromises or adaptations do you think you may have to make in order to be a team player?
  </p>
  <p>Submit your reflection to the dropbox in Canvas.
