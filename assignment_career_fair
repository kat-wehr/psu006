<h2>Career Fair Assignment Details
</h2>
<h4>Part 1: Goal Statement
</h4>
<p>Identify a career experience from the list below. Please note the date, time, and requirements for each experience and consider these when making your selection. You only need to attend ONE event to satisfy the requirements for this class, however, you may find more than one of these events helpful in making decisions about majors and exploring potential career options. Feel free to attend as many as you would like.
</p>
<p>After making a choice, think about why you chose that event. Compose and submit at least TWO goals you hope to achieve by attending your event. Some examples of good goals include: "Speak to a recruiter from 'ABC Corp' at Internship Day" and "Collect at least three marketing internship leads at Internship Day" or "Learn about accounting careers during the session at Smeal Career Blitz" and "Determine two Smeal majors that I would like to pursue as potential options after attending Smeal Career Blitz."
</p>
<p>Submit your goal statements to the drop box in Canvas at least one day prior to your chosen event.

You can do this by simply asking for their business card after you've talked to them. Asking for business cards is standard business practice.

<p>After you attend your chosen event, please compose a 1-2 page journal reflection (double spaced) about your experience. In your reflection, be sure to include:
</p>
<ul><li>The name of the event you attended, as well as the date.</li><li>Some thoughts about why you chose this event.</li><li>Your analysis of your goals. Did you achieve both goals? How did you achieve them? What surprised you about how easy or difficult it was to achieve these goals? If you did not achieve your goals, that is okay. Failure is a part of learning experiences. Discuss why you were unable to achieve your goals and how this experience might affect your plans going forward. Is there another way you can achieve your goals at a different event?&nbsp;</li><li>Please be candid in your reflections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please submit your journal reflection to the drop box in Canvas within 24 hours of the conclusion of your chosen event.
